--I started by doing some data cleansing on SQL:

ALTER TABLE listings
  DROP column name, last_review, reviews_per_month, license
  
  
  --Grouping by price per neighbourhood_group:
  
  SELECT DISTINCT neighbourhood_group, AVG (price) AS avg_price
  FROM listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood_group
  
  
  --Grouping by neighbourhoods and price:
  
  SELECT DISTINCT neighbourhood, neighbourhood_group, 
AVG (price) OVER (PARTITION BY neighbourhood) AS avg_price
  FROM listings
  ORDER BY neighbourhood_group
